    "--Using Microsoft Graph ---- and Safely--\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Microsoft Graph is a very powerful API. \n",
    "It provides access not only or read not only to SharePoint lists, but also to OneDrive files, Teams messages, users, groups, and in some cases even emails. Because of this broad capability, \n",
    "it is considered a high-privilege integration point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concern with Microsoft Graph is that if we grant wide permissions such as Sites.Read.All, the application could potentially access all SharePoint sites within the tenant. This creates a broad access surface and increases the risk of accidental overexposure of sensitive business data. That is why organizations apply strict security and governance controls before allowing Graph-based integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important reason is data protection and compliance. our organizations handlling sensitive healthcare/personal data. If permissions are not properly restricted, there is a risk of data leakage or audit failures. Therefore, security teams prefer a least-privilege approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent these risks, we can take specific actions.\n",
    " -First, instead of using broad permissions like Sites.Read.All, we can use Sites.Selected and grant access only to the required SharePoint site. (This ensures the application cannot access other sites in the tenant). \n",
    " -Second, we should store secrets securely using Azure Key Vault or certificate-based authentication instead of keeping secrets inside notebooks.\n",
    " -Third, we must ensure proper logging, monitoring, and governance documentation so that every access is traceable and auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Graph can be safely used if we follow a least-privilege access model, restrict it to specific sites, secure authentication properly, and align with organizational governance standards(HIPPA GAPPA GDPR NHS)."
