    "✅ DevOps Comment (Initial Discovery / Info Required)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Discovery – Information Required Before Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have access to the two SharePoint lists and have reviewed their schemas:\n",
    "\n",
    "gold_model_governance (includes Choice fields: originating_layer, status, model_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "gold_measure_governance (includes multi-line text fields including DAX Measure)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we implement “pull into UDM”, we need the following clarifications to align with the existing VHG Fabric architecture and governance process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Business Definition / Requirements Source (Monday / Governance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a Monday.com board item or documented requirement we should reference for this ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "If Monday is not available for this request, can we confirm this ticket description is the single source of truth for scope/definitions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is the business owner / approver for these lists and for any future changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Target Layer, Environment and Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Which environment(s) should be implemented: DEV only or DEV → TEST → PROD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which Fabric workspace/lakehouse should host the output tables (UDM workspace vs Silver workspace vs Gold workspace)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Should these be “UDM layer” tables (curated) or a mirrored metadata copy accessible to UDM?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Naming Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Please confirm expected naming for created objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Silver tables: e.g. silver_gold_model_governance, silver_gold_measure_governance\n",
    "\n",
    "UDM tables/views: e.g. udm_gold_model_metadata, udm_gold_measure_metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Any preferred schema/folder location for notebooks/pipelines?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Refresh & Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected refresh frequency: daily / weekly / on-demand?\n",
    "\n",
    "Should this be part of an existing pipeline (e.g., UDM master pipeline) or a separate governance ingestion pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any dependency on semantic model refresh after load?\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Change Management / Schema Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Are the SharePoint list columns expected to remain stable (schema freeze)?\n",
    "\n",
    "For Choice columns (originating_layer, status, model_name), can new Choice values be added over time, and should we treat them as valid automatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "6) DAX Measure Governance (Critical)\n",
    "\n",
    "For gold_measure_governance:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the DAX Measure text changes, do we need version history (retain old definitions) or is latest overwrite sufficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is SharePoint versioning enabled and should we rely on it for audit, or do we need to build history in Fabric?\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed Technical Approach (subject to confirmation)\n",
    "\n",
    "SharePoint → Dataflow Gen2 → Silver metadata tables → UDM curated metadata tables (full refresh).\n",
    "\n",
    "Awaiting the above clarifications before proceeding with implementation."
